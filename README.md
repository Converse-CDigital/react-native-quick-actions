## Installing

```bash
$ yarn add react-native-quick-actions
$ react-native link react-native-quick-actions
```

### Additional steps on iOS

Add the following lines to your `AppDelegate.m` file:

```obj-c
#import "RNQuickActionManager.h"

// @implementation AppDelegate

- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application performActionForShortcutItem:(UIApplicationShortcutItem *)shortcutItem completionHandler:(void (^)(BOOL succeeded)) completionHandler {
  [RNQuickActionManager onQuickActionPress:shortcutItem completionHandler:completionHandler];
}

// @end
```

## Usage

### Adding static quick actions - iOS only

Add these entries into to your `Info.plist` file and replace the generic stuff (Action Title, .action, etc):

```xml
<key>UIApplicationShortcutItems</key>
<array>
  <dict>
    <key>UIApplicationShortcutItemIconType</key>
    <string>UIApplicationShortcutIconTypeLocation</string>
    <key>UIApplicationShortcutItemTitle</key>
    <string>Action Title</string>
    <key>UIApplicationShortcutItemType</key>
    <string>$(PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER).action</string>
  </dict>
</array>
```

A full list of available icons can be found here:

### Adding dynamic quick actions (only option available for android as of now)

In order to add / remove dynamic actions during application lifecycle, you need to import `react-native-quick-actions` and call either `setShortcutItems` to set actions or `clearShortcutItems` to clear.

```js
import QuickActions from "react-native-quick-actions";

QuickActions.setShortcutItems([
  {
    type: "Orders", // Required
    title: "See your orders", // Optional, if empty, `type` will be used instead
    subtitle: "See orders you've made",
    icon: "Compose", // Icons instructions below
    userInfo: {
      url: "app://orders" // Provide any custom data like deep linking URL
    }
  }
]);
```

**NOTE** Currently android only supports a `url` key in `userInfo`. No other keys are supported. See [#93](https://github.com/jordanbyron/react-native-quick-actions/issues/93) for more information.

To clear actions:

```js
QuickActions.clearShortcutItems();
```

#### Icons

##### iOS

On iOS you can use the default icons provided by Apple, they're listed here: https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/icons-and-images/system-icons/#quick-action-icons

You can also use custom icons creating new Image set inside Image.xcassets on XCode. You'll need to define the 1x, 2x and 3x sizes.

##### Android

On Android you'll need to create an image file (use PNG) inside `android/app/src/main/res/drawable`.

Name the image with underscores, don't use hyphens.

### Listening for quick actions

When app is in background, you need to listen to the actions.

```js
import QuickActions from "react-native";
```

Use `quickActionEmitter` to listen for `quickActionEventName` messages.

```js
const listener = QuickActions.quickActionEmitter.addListener(QuickActions.quickActionEventName, (data) => {
      console.log('data here', data)
      if (data) {
        // handleQuickAction(data.type)
      }
    })
    
 // remove listener at unmount
 return () => {
    listener.remove()
  }
```

To get any actions sent when the app is cold-launched using the following code:

```js
import QuickActions from "react-native-quick-actions";

function doSomethingWithTheAction(data) {
  console.log(data.title);
  console.log(data.type);
  console.log(data.userInfo);
}

QuickActions.popInitialAction()
  .then(doSomethingWithTheAction)
  .catch(console.error);
```

Please note that on Android if android:launchMode is set to default value standard in AndroidManifest.xml, the app will be re-created each time when app is being brought back from background and it won't receive quickActionShortcut event from DeviceEventEmitter, instead popInitialAction will be receiving the app shortcut event.

Also note that when JS Debugging is true, popInitialAction() returns null. Disable debugging for this issue.

### Check if 3D Touch is supported

The following function will alert you if the user's device supports 3D Touch. Please
note this project currently only supports iOS 9+ which means this code will not
work on iOS devices running versions < 9.0.

```js
import QuickActions from "react-native-quick-actions";

QuickActions.isSupported((error, supported) => {
  if (!supported) {
    console.log("Device does not support 3D Touch or 3D Touch is disabled.");
  }
});
```
